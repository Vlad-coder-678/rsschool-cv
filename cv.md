I took various courses CodeForMySelf, FreeCodeCamp, HTML Academy and other.
Last completed project: https://github.com/Vlad-coder-678/profitum-react-app
My goal at this stage is to get a job on simple projects. Try my skills in the developer community in order to assess my strengths and understand where to go next.
My skills are knowledge of English at the level of reading documentation and watching videos with an understanding of the essence.
